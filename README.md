## Starter Repository

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

# NestJS-arch

NestJS arch is an open-source application that provides a secure and scalable architecture. The project leverages various technologies such as Docker, different JWT strategies, Prisma ORM, request/response tracking, database logging, Redis for storing hashed access tokens, refresh token mechanism, storing refresh tokens in the database, IP-based single sign-on, CORS, Helmet for security, custom header middlewares, and maximum login attempts enforcement.

## Description

The Project Name aims to simplify the management and security of electronic health records (EHR) through a robust and extensible application. It utilizes Docker containers to provide an isolated and scalable environment for the application and its dependencies.

The project incorporates different JWT (JSON Web Token) strategies for authentication and authorization. It supports access token and refresh token mechanisms, with access tokens being securely hashed and stored in Redis. Refresh tokens are securely stored in the database, allowing for efficient token revocation and renewal.

To enhance security, IP-based single sign-on is implemented, ensuring that users can access their accounts only from trusted IP addresses. The project also implements various security measures such as CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and Helmet middleware to mitigate common security vulnerabilities.

Request and response tracking is implemented to log incoming and outgoing requests, providing valuable insights and troubleshooting capabilities. Additionally, database logging is enabled, allowing for detailed tracking and analysis of database transactions.

The project integrates Prisma ORM for database management, providing an intuitive and efficient interface for working with the underlying database. Prisma migrations are used to manage database schema changes and ensure consistency across different environments.

In addition to the aforementioned features, the project includes custom header middlewares for fine-grained control over HTTP headers, as well as enforcing maximum login attempts to protect against brute-force attacks.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ByteCodeBuddha/nestjs-arch.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nestjs-arch`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn install`

## Configuration

The project requires some configuration to work properly. Follow these steps to set up the configuration:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
2. Fill in the necessary environment variables in the `.env` file based on your requirements. Here's an example:

```dotenv
# Environment
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:admin@123@localhost:5432/ehr?schema=public"

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# JWT
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU123456789

# SSO
SSO=true

# Logging
DB_LOGGING=true
REQUEST_RESPONSE_LOGGING=true
SECURITY_LOGGING=true
```

## Database Setup

The project uses a database for data storage. Follow these steps to set up the database:

### Development Database

1. Start the development database: `yarn db:dev:up` <!-- Start the development database container -->
2. Deploy the Prisma migrations for the development environment: `yarn prisma:dev:deploy` <!-- Deploy Prisma migrations for development -->

### Test Database

1. Start the test database: `yarn db:test:up` <!-- Start the test database container -->
2. Deploy the Prisma migrations for the test environment: `yarn prisma:test:deploy` <!-- Deploy Prisma migrations for testing -->

## Usage

To start the project, use the following commands:

- Start the project in development mode: `yarn start:dev` <!-- Start the project in development mode -->
- Start the project in debug mode: `yarn start:debug` <!-- Start the project in debug mode -->
- Start the project in production mode: `yarn start:prod` <!-- Start the project in production mode -->

## Testing
